# Native image galleries

## Scope

- Pinch between fit and 8x; double-tap around the touched point to 2.5x and back.
- Swipe at fit to turn pages. While enlarged, dragging pans only; a pinch must not start a page turn.
- A gallery is one composer tray, user message, rendered Markdown body, tool result, generated batch, plugin gallery or forum body. Markdown workspace and web/data images are separate groups. Forum quotes/details form their own groups. Standalone workspace file previews remain single-image.
- Attachments keep original bytes, Hero transitions, close/save buttons and their long-press menu. Taps while enlarged do not close attachments. Generated/plugin images retain tap-to-toggle controls.
- Workspace image pages retain file actions, the 32 MiB remote preview limit and a watch for the selected file. Revisiting a file invalidates its decoded image cache, including updates received while another page was selected.
- PDF zoom, wallpaper/icon editors and WebView content are unchanged.

## Automated checks

From `app/`, with the repository's Flutter/Dart versions and test fonts installed:

```sh
flutter analyze --no-pub
flutter test --no-pub \
  test/chat/image_gallery_test.dart \
  test/chat/attachment_gallery_test.dart \
  test/chat/reply_gallery_test.dart \
  test/chat/workspace_gallery_refresh_test.dart \
  test/chat/image_viewer_theme_test.dart \
  test/chat/inline_image_provider_test.dart \
  test/chat/tool_images_test.dart \
  test/chat/markdown_render_test.dart \
  test/chat/attachments_test.dart \
  test/media/media_card_test.dart \
  test/plugins/view/plugin_view_figures_test.dart \
  test/files/file_preview_test.dart \
  test/forum/forum_image_gallery_test.dart
```

Set `DSH_TEST_FONT_DIR` if Noto CJK fonts are installed somewhere other than the test harness's default. Widget tests must use a tester engine matching the host architecture. From the repository root, also run `python3 app/tool/guide_sync.py --check`.

## Original workspace validation record

The following results were recorded in the original workspace before porting to main; they are not validation of the port.

- Flutter 3.47.7 / Dart 3.13.5, Linux ARM64 tester: `flutter analyze --no-pub` passed with no issues. Guide sync and `git diff --check` passed.
- The 13-file matrix above passed 137 tests with `--concurrency=2 --name '^(?!golden figures)'`; this includes all 23 new gallery tests and the real decoded-image regression (4x4 PNG replaced by 7x3 PNG while another file is watched).
- The three existing `golden figures` cases were also exercised by the earlier unfiltered matrix and failed: dark/light/narrow-large differ by 43/43/56 pixels (reported 0.01%), visible on fixture thumbnail edges. Baselines were not updated. Their root cause has not been reproduced against an isolated pre-change baseline; the unfiltered screenshot suite is not green.
- APK build, installation and physical touchscreen checks were not run. The commands above are focused checks, not the complete application test suite.

## Android acceptance (requires a rebuilt APK)

1. Attach three different pictures and a text file. Open picture two in the composer, while sending, after sending and in an offline replay. Swipe both ways: only this message's pictures belong to the gallery; page/name/save bytes follow the selected picture.
2. Double-tap a detail, pan horizontally/vertically, then pinch to fit. Zooming must not close the page or change the image. At fit, swiping changes pages; first/last pages do not wrap. Close explicitly and check the originating picture is still visible.
3. Test a reply with two workspace pictures, two web/data pictures, repeated URLs, HTML images, fenced/inline image-looking code and an unsupported/SVG image. Only rendered previewable pictures belong to their own group's ordered snapshot, not another reply's images.
4. Open a tool's second picture, a generated batch and a plugin gallery. Keep original source labels, generation actions and no save/share when plugin bytes are unavailable. A missing/loading attachment must not prevent swiping back to a good page.
5. Open workspace image A, swipe to B, overwrite A at the same path, then return to A. Check the visible pixels, not only file-read counts. Modify/delete/recreate the selected file and check refresh/error recovery. On a remote host, files exceeding 32 MiB must still show the size-limit action.
6. Open two forum pictures and check full-resolution URLs, fallback to `src`, quoted/detail galleries, error pages and close. Check light/dark themes, portrait/landscape safe areas and a large system font.

Do not treat Linux widget results as installed-APK or physical touchscreen verification.
