# Hot reload on a real phone, over the release build already on it, data kept.
#
#   tooling/dev-run.sh                build debug, install, launch, attach
#   tooling/dev-run.sh --attach       restart the debug build already installed, attach
#   tooling/dev-run.sh --no-build     install the last debug APK, then attach
#   tooling/dev-run.sh --wifi         move adb to Wi-Fi first (the cable may go after)
#   tooling/dev-run.sh -s SERIAL      which device, when more than one is connected
#
# Then, in this terminal: r hot reload, R hot restart, d detach (the app keeps running),
# q quit (the app stops).
# Code changed before attaching isn't what r looks at, it starts from what is on disk at
# attach: press R once for that. r takes care of everything changed after.
#
# Going back to a release build takes a new one: a debug build has a newer build number
# than the last release, and Android refuses a lower one.
#
# It installs with `adb install -r` and attaches, instead of `flutter run`, because a
# failed `flutter run` install uninstalls the app and tries again, and that would take
# the phone's keys and chats with it. Here a failed install stops, and changes nothing.
# That takes the same signing key (app/android/key.properties) and a versionCode that
# isn't lower: both are how build-apk.sh builds.
#
# Debug builds run on the JIT and animate worse than a release build, so use this for
# layout, sizes and colours. Judge smoothness on a release build (tooling/build-apk.sh).
#
# Windows: the Android toolchain lives in
# DSH_ANDROID_TOOLS (default D:/Tools/android), Flutter in DSH_FLUTTER (default
# D:/Tools/flutter-3.47.7/flutter), Python in DSH_PYTHON. Elsewhere, what's on PATH.
